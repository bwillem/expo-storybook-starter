# notes

## Consistency
Everything needs to be themed. A collection of theme variables effectively becomes the brand experience. Most visual properties can be themed: colors, spacing scales, type scales and styles, borders and border radii; if it can be described in css it can be stored in variables and resused.

## Maintainability
How something looks doesn’t matter as much as how maintainable it is. If it’s built with this in mind, we can quickly and easily change how it looks.

## Velocity
Developers should be able to build and maintain new UI quickly and reliably with applepie’s api.

## Scalability
The system should be resistant to company and codebase growing pains. This means it's extendable and can scale.

## Flexibility
It's never finished, it's in a constant state of reengineering. Patterns are not dogmas, they can change and adapt.
