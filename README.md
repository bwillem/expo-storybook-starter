Everything needs to be themed. A collection of theme variables effectively becomes the brand experience. Most visual properties can be themed: colors, spacing scales, type scales and styles, borders and border radii; if it can be described in css it can be stored in variables and resused.

How something looks doesn’t matter as much as how maintainable it is. If it’s built with this in mind, we can quickly and easily change how it looks.

The system should be resistant to company and codebase growing pains. It is never finished but in a constant state of reengineering. Patterns are not dogmas, they can change and adapt.
